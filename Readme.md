The code provided above is an implementation of littlefs in NOR flash(MT25QL) using barebone or embedded C system. The code can be used in any NOR flash just need to change configurations in nor.h where the register mapping/spi command of the flash is to be redefined.  The version of littlefs seems to be a bit older. If the same lfs.h file is to be used in both systems then it's working fine.
